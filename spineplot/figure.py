    A class to represent a single figure in a plot. This class serves

    Attributes
    ----------
    _figure : matplotlib.figure.Figure

        The size of the figure to create.
    _style : Style
        The style to use when drawing the figure.
    _title : str
        The title of the figure.
    _axs : list
        A list of axes objects that will be used to plot the figure.
